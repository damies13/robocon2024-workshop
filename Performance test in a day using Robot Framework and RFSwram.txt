Proposal title:	Performance test in a day using Robot Framework and RFSwram
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Session type:	Workshop full day
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this workshop you'll see how you can use Robot Framework and RFSwarm to begin performance testing on day 1 with a new to you application.

Starting from scratch you will write test cases and tune them for performance testing and by end of the day run a performance test and then generate a report suitable for presenting your results.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attendees of this workshop will write some simple tests with robot framework, then make adjustments to those tests to prepare them for performance testing with RFSwarm, setup RFSwam components (Agent, Manager & Reporter), then run a performance test with RFSwam using the test cases created and prepare a test report from the performance test results and finally create a template of the report for future tests

If time allows we'll cover monitoring of the AUT server, integration with CI/CD builds, Agents running in the cloud, and any questions that come up.

The workshop will be based on a CRM application to be representative of a typical application you might find in a work environment, The test steps to navigate the application as this would normally be provided to the test automation team.

Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Each attendee will need to be provided with two computers, OS is not important but should be a Desktop OS (Windows/Mac/Linux are ok)
  - One will be for running the RFSwarm Manager and Reporter as wall as for creating/editing Robot Framework test cases
  - The other will be for installing and running the RFSwarm Agent
- As the presenter I will need a way to host an application for the attendee's to performance test and also need to be able to connect my presenter machine to the network as well.
  - Ideally the workshop room would be a self contained network with internet access (needed for when attendee's do pip installs
  - Ideally workshop room network will have a virtual machine server I can run a VM on for the simulated AUT
  - If you need me to bring the hardware for the simulated AUT, I will need 2 Ethernet/WIFI connections to the workshop room network, however as I will be coming from Australia I will be very limited in what I can bring with me.

Lessons Learned:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How to tune a Robot Framework test case for optimal use with RFSwarm
- How using RFSwarm can help an organization start performance testing quicker on their projects
- How to use the various components of RFSwarm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Describe your intended audience:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- People who currently use Robot Framework and are interesting in performance testing
- People who currently use other performance testing tools and are interested in Robot Framework
- People who currently use other performance testing tools and already use Robot Framework for other testing
